This is the gists repo. All of the gists are included and a rakefile (ruby make) is included
so that you can make each one easily. This is going to be the list of them as they will appear 
in the rake file just for convenience.

rake task 		=> file
bit_fields		=> bit_fields.cpp
templess_swap	=> templess_swap.cpp
text_to_binary 	=> text_to_binary.cpp
